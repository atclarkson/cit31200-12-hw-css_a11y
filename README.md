Accessibility is important for your users. Not only when it comes to color schemes, but images as well and the  size of fonts too. This isn't necessarily for those who are impaired either, this is also for a general user so they can read your content.

__Task:__ Create an HTML page with images and poor text colors and fonts

__My Requirements:__

- Add five different images to your HTML and make sure they all have their alt added with the name of the image inside of it so users can identify what that image is
- Create a `<ul>` that lists 3 bad colors you shouldn't use. Color the color's name with that color.
- Lastly, create one more, `<ul>`
  - In each `<li>`, display four fonts.  
    - 2 good fonts that are good for users
    - two bad fonts that are bad on users' eyes. 
    - Write the name of the font in the `<li>` 
    - make sure these fonts are loaded and displayed
